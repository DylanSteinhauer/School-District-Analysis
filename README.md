# School-District-Analysis
## Purpose
I used Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze data on student funding and test taking.
For the challenge, I ommitted Thomas High School's math and reading scores due to potential academic dishonesty.
In addition, I repreated the analysis without Thomas High Schools's scores to see how this affected the analysis.
## Results
### District Summary
